This article studies view-invariant human action recognition. Major contrivbutions are:

- Explores view-invariant action representation in multi-view videos using convolutional features.
- Current methods are computationally expensive and limit temporal coverage in short segments.
- Proposed framework uses a temporal vector of locally aggregated descriptors (T-VLAD) to encode long-term video temporal structure.
- T-VLAD encodes video's long-term temporal structure using single stream convolutional features over short segments.
- Results validated in a challenging setup with one view for testing and remaining views for training.
- State-of-the-art results obtained on three multi-view datasets with fixed cameras and a dynamic background dataset, UCF101.
